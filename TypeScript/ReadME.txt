Watch mode in typescript-It will compile the code automatically again and again
This will only compile 1 file at a time

tsc filename.ts --watch




we also want package.json file for that we will do 

tsc --init




if we want to use multiple files compile at same time when we change then we will create a package.json and then 
tsc --w
